    <h1>Pancake</h1>
    Make crispy mashed potato pancakes that stay fluffy inside in a snap with leftover mashed potatoes. I like to make one large potato pancake and slice it into wedges, but you can make individual-sized potato pancakes, which are easier to flip, if you prefer.

<p>Steps:
    Mix the potatoes, potato starch, egg, seasonings, and a teaspoon of chives in one bowl. 
Heat oil in a skillet, then spoon the potato mixture into the skillet. Press it into an even layer to create a potato pancake.
Reduce heat, cover the skillet, and cook until golden brown around the edges.
Slide the pancake onto a large plate, then invert it onto another greased plate.
Heat the remaining oil, then slide the pancake back into the skillet and cook, uncovered, until golden brown on the other side.
